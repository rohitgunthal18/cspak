            <h2>Q1 What is a computer network? Explain it's types.</h2>
            <h4 align="justify"> A Computer Network can be defined as a group of computers and other peripheral devices that are linked together for the purpose of sharing data and hardware resources. Computer Networks help in information sharing, resource sharing, efficient use of storage timely communication, etc. The different types of computer networks <br>

                Personal Area Network (PAN) — <br>  This network is used to establish communication among computer devices within the range of 20 to 30 feet. This network maybe wired with computer buses (e.g. USB) or maybe a wireless network through Bluetooth. <br>
                Local Area Network (LAN) — <br> It is a digital communication system that interconnects a large number of computers and other peripheral devices. This type of network is generally preferred within a smaller area such as an office building or a lab building (say within a radius of half a kilometer). <br>
                Campus Area Network (CAN) — <br> This network connects two or more LANs that are limited to specific geographical area viz. college campus, office buildings, etc.
                Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) — <br> This network connects two or more local area networks or campus area networks together. It prefers routers, switches and hubs but doesn't extend beyond the boundaries of the immediate town/city. <br>
                Wide Area Network (WAN) — <br> It is a digital communication system that interconnects a large number of computers in a wide area. This type of communication network can operate worldwide. In a WAN, telephone lines, microwave, satellite links, etc. can be used as transmission mediums.</h3>

                <h2>Q2 Write shorte note on 1.LAN 2.MAN 3.WAN</h2>
                <h4 align="justify"> 1. LAN- <br>
                    It is a network of two or more computers and peripherals devices spread with a small geographical area like a room,office,building or campus. All the computers and the LAN can be connected through cables or wireless links for communication. The number of computers in a LAN can vary from two to hundred .Speed of LAN is faster and the chances of data loss is very less. <br>
                    
                   2. MAN- <br>
                    MAN is a larger network as compared to LAN. It covers a metro city. It is used to connect the smaller networks of an organisation spread across the city. The coverage area of the MAN can range from 10 to 50 km. <br>
                    
                    3. WAN- <br>
                    This type of network covers a very large geographical area across the country or continent. WAN is generally established by the large organisation, having offices spread across the country or in different countries. Because of widespread area of WAN the data transfer rate is lower and the chances of the data transfer error are more as compared to land .Railway reservation systems, airline reservation systems and ATMs are the good example of WAN. <br>

                <h2>Q3 What is topology? Explain bus topology.</h2>
                <h4 align="Justify">Bus Topology:
                    Bus topology is a network type in which every computer and network device is connected to a single cable. It transmits the data from one end to another in a single direction. No bi-directional feature is in bus topology. It is a multi-point connection and a non-robust topology because if the backbone fails the topology crashes. In Bus Topology, various MAC (Media Access Control) protocols are followed by LAN ethernet connections like TDMA, Pure Aloha, CDMA, Slotted Aloha, etc.

                     Figure : A bus topology with shared backbone cable. The nodes are connected to the channel via drop lines. 
                    
                    Advantages of this topology: 
                    
                    If N devices are connected to each other in a bus topology, then the number of cables required to connect them is 1, which is known as backbone cable, and N drop lines are required.
                    The cost of the cable is less compared to other topologies, but it is used to build small networks.
                     Problems with this topology: 
                    
                    If the common cable fails, then the whole system will crash down.
                    If the network traffic is heavy, it increases collisions in the network. To avoid this, various protocols are used in the MAC layer known as Pure Aloha, Slotted Aloha, CSMA/CD, etc.
                    Security is very low.
